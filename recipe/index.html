    <h1>Gnocchi</h1>
    <p>This impressive gnocchi recipe couldn't be easier to make with three cheap ingredients you probably already have on hand.You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h2>What is Gnocchi?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gnocchi (singular gnocco) are Italian dumplings made with flour, eggs, and potatoes. Gnocchi can be served in tomato sauce, tossed with pesto, or saut√©ed with butter and herbs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is Gnocchi made of?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Potatoes:</b> Use starchy potatoes, such as russets.</li>
        <li><b>Flour:</b> All-purpose flour absorbs moisture and helps create gluten.</li>
        <li><b>Egg:</b> An egg lends moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the dumplings together.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and mash with a fork or potato masher.</li>
        <li>Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour, and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into 1/2-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Can you freeze Gnocchi?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Yes! You can freeze gnocchi. After shaping them, prior to the cooking step, arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet. Place in the freezer. Once the gnocchi are frozen, transfer to a bag or container for a future meal. Drop directly into boiling salted water and proceed with the recipe.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What to Serve with Gnocchi Dishes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Arugula Salad with Shaved Parmesan</li>
        <li>Caesar Salad with Garlic Croutons</li>
        <li>Caprese Zucchini Salad</li>
        <li>Beet, Carrot, and Pomegranate Salad</li>
    </ul>
