    <h1>Gnocchi</h1>
    <p>This impressive gnocchi recipe couldn't be easier to make with three cheap ingredients you probably already have on hand.Gnocchi (singular gnocco) are Italian dumplings made with flour, eggs, and potatoes. Gnocchi can be served in tomato sauce, tossed with pesto, or saut√©ed with butter and herbs.</p>
    <h2>What is Gnocchi made of?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Potatoes:</b> Use starchy potatoes, such as russets.</li>
        <li><b>Flour:</b> All-purpose flour absorbs moisture and helps create gluten.</li>
        <li><b>Egg:</b> An egg lends moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the dumplings together.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, and mash with a fork or potato masher.</li>
        <li>Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour, and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into 1/2-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.</li>
    </ol>
