                <p>An activity once perceived exclusive to the rich and snobby, golf has quickly become one of the
                    fastest-growing sports in America</p>
                <br>
                <p>Driving over $100 billion in economic activity throughout the U.S. in 2022, an increase of 20% over
                    its $84.1 billion impact in 2016 according to a study by the <a href="https://www.golfcoalition.org/_files/ugd/e10443_74f0b4605e1144daa7da7f1cf2403ef9.pdf" class="source">American Golf Industry Coalition</a>, new event
                    venues such as TopGolf have made the game not only more enjoyable but more accessible as well</p>
                <br>
                <p>But what exactly is causing this boom?</p>

                </script>
                <h2>The Pandemic</h2>
                <p>In a period of boredom and loss, Covid-19 left families separated and searching for an escape. The
                    solution? Golf.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The sport allowed people to spend hours outside, with friends and family while still distancing
                    themselves. Over 39.6 million golfers currently play on a nine or eighteen-hole course, a 15%
                    increase from 2020 according to <a href="https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com/c42c7bf4-dca7-00ea-4f2e-373223f80f76/5e780495-cdee-4157-ad3f-3f1aef5a773b/The%20R%26A%20Global%20Golf%20Participation%20Report%202023.pdf" class="source">The R&A Global Golf Participation Report.</a></p>
                <br>
                <p>Beyond the growth of the game post-pandemic, golfers positively impacted the sport’s economy in ways
                    never seen before. According to the American Golf Industry Coalition, over 1.6 million jobs were
                    directly or indirectly created from the game’s boom.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The comeback from the pandemic was difficult for many, with people losing their jobs and businesses.
                    Golf helped vitalize the workforce, providing opportunity and optimism for the community.</p>

                </script>
                <h2>Diverse Participants</h2>
                <p>With a rough past of racism and gender discrimination, golf has pushed itself to do better over the
                    past couple of decades, refusing to tolerate any prejudice. It was not until 1961 when the first
                    black professional golfer joined the PGA Tour and not until 1950 that the LPGA was created.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, since 2019 there has been a net gain in female golfers of 800,000, up 14% during that period
                    according to the <a href="https://www.ngf.org/golf-industry-research/#golfers" class="source">National Golf Foundation.</a>  While the game still has a lot on its plate when it comes
                    to diversity, the influx of juniors has allowed the sport to reach younger generations.</p>
                <br>
                <p>According to the National Golf Foundation, 3.4 Million Juniors played golf on a course in 2022, its
                    highest level since 2006. Not only are more younger individuals playing golf, but many younger women
                    are than ever before, with 37% of today's juniors being girls compared to 15% in 2000.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While golf continues to expand, so does its entertainment value.</p>
                <iframe title="Change in Player Participation" aria-label="Grouped Columns" id="datawrapper-chart-iTx4G" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iTx4G/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="425" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
                </script>
                <h2>The Amusing Aspects</h2>
                <p>Many people either watch or play sports because of the enjoyment it brings them, a feature golf
                    seemed to last in the past. A game that used to be exclusive, golf has expanded into 16,000 courses
                    at 14,000 facilities according to the National Golf Foundation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The increase in playable courses stretches far beyond the course itself to entertainment venues such
                    as TopGolf. The Callaway-owned brand was responsible for 38% of individuals who played golf in 2022,
                    contributing $1.5 billion to their total revenue of $3.995 billion according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellore/2023/04/04/topgolf-callaway-brands-positioned-to-thrive-as-golf-industry-evolves/?sh=4de113dd4444" class="source">Forbes.</a></p>
                <br>
                <p>Although many people love to play, some love to watch. Netflix’s documentary “Full Swing” made it
                    into the network's <a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/story/why-theres-good-reason-to-believe-golfs-surge-in-popularity-will-endure" class="source">top 15 most-streamed list</a> on its debut in February, inspiring others to watch the
                    sport.</p>
                <br>
                <p> All of these factors drove the game of golf to heightened levels of popularity, but what is next?

                <h2>The Future of Golf</h2>
                <p>The game will keep inviting new athletes and demographics to challenge themselves among the best in
                    the world. As businesses continue to boom and people keep spending money, the sky becomes the limit
                    for the golf economy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Golf’s direct and indirect economic impact in the U.S. eclipsed $226.515 Billion in 2022, a trend
                    that will likely continue.</p>
