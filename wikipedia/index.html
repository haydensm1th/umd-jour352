                <p>The San Diego Padres are an American professional baseball team based in San Diego. The Padres compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West division. Founded in 1969, the club has won two NL pennants—in 1984 and 1998, losing in the World Series both years. As of 2022, they have had 16 winning seasons in franchise history.</p>

                <p>The Padres are one of two Major League Baseball teams (the other being the Los Angeles Angels) in California to originate from the state; the Athletics were originally from Philadelphia (and moved to the state from Kansas City), and the Dodgers and Giants are originally from two New York City boroughs—Brooklyn and Manhattan, respectively. As of 2023, the Padres are the only team in California not to have won a World Series.

                    Following the relocation of the Chargers to Los Angeles in 2017, the Padres became the only franchise in the four major American professional sports leagues in the San Diego sports market</p>
                <p>From 1969 through 2022, the Padres have an overall record of 3,952–4,568 (.464)</p>

            <h2>Rivalries</h2>
            <p>The Padres' historical rivalry against the Los Angeles Dodgers has often been largely lopsided in favor of LA, however; recent growth between the two teams in competition during the 2020s has added intensity on top of proximity between Los Angeles and San Diego (driving from Dodger Stadium to Petco Park can be done by simply taking Interstate 5). San Diego fans have often harbored animosity towards Los Angeles due in small part to San Diego being an unstable home for multiple sports franchises as both the Chargers and the Clippers had relocated to Los Angeles after being unable to secure either a new arena or stable finances in San Diego.</p>
            <p>The Dodgers currently lead the series 504–412, although both teams have a series win in the postseason (Los Angeles won the 2020 NLDS, while San Diego returned the favor in 2022). Off the field, the rivalry has been just as competitive, as the two teams have aggressively battled on the trade market and free agency over numerous star players</p>
